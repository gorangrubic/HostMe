# HostMe (imbVeles fork)
Improvements by Goran GrubiÄ‡ (http://blog.veles.rs):

* Supports multiple instances running as it is able to auto detect unused port and reassign it if the one from the configuration is already server. 

> This is controllable from: Configuration.doAutoSelectUnusedPort

* Automatically opens the index.html of the hosted site, with default OS web browser (Win, iOS, Linux - supported)

> This is controllable from: Configuration.doAutoOpenDefaultBrowser

* Log files creation is now possible to turn off from configuration

> This is controllable from: Configuration.doDisableLogFiles

* Added sample site content (actually Bootstrap 4 Scrolling Nav template)
